# AI Chatbot Usability, Responsiveness, and Reliability in Enhancing Online Customer Experience in Lagos, Nigeria

## 📌 Project Overview
This project investigates how AI chatbots influence customer satisfaction during online shopping experiences. It focuses on three primary chatbot attributes—usability, responsiveness, and reliability—and evaluates their relationships with customer satisfaction. The research data was obtained from students in Lagos, Nigeria, and analyzed using descriptive statistics, correlation, and regression analysis.

## Data Source
The data was collected through structured questionnaires distributed to 104 university students in Lagos, Nigeria. The questions targeted users’ experiences with AI chatbots in online shopping contexts.

## ⚒️ Tools
- **Data Collection**: Structured Questionnaire (Likert scale: 1 to 5)  
- **Analysis**: SPSS  
- **Documentation**: Microsoft Word, GitHub  
- **Visualization**: Embedded Charts & Tables (SPSS-generated)

## 🧹 Data Cleaning/Preparation
- Filtered valid responses (n = 104)  
- Encoded responses numerically for Likert scale analysis  
- Grouped and tabulated demographics (gender, age, education level)  
- Removed duplicates and ensured no missing entries  
- Calculated mean responses for descriptive interpretation  
- Prepared variables for correlation and regression analyses

### Regression Results
#### Model 1: Usability → Satisfaction

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e5ddf7eb-cbf0-4279-ac61-ce2155aae0f5)

- R² = 0.489  
- β = 0.784, p < 0.001  
- Interpretation: 48.9% of the variance in satisfaction can be explained by usability  

#### Model 2: Responsiveness → Satisfaction

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8a320f13-8634-45d6-9a98-65261125f76f)

- R² = 0.532  
- β = 0.750, p < 0.001  
- Interpretation: 53.2% of the variance in satisfaction can be explained by responsiveness  

#### Model 3: Reliability → Satisfaction

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2f0576b8-84a3-4f5f-ac72-60df3f4fb21e)

- R² = 0.474  
- β = 0.723, p < 0.001  
- Interpretation: 47.4% of the variance in satisfaction can be explained by chatbot reliability  

## Results/Findings
- Majority of respondents rated chatbot interaction as positive  
- Responsiveness had the strongest correlation with satisfaction (r = 0.730)  
- Usability and reliability were also moderately correlated with satisfaction  
- Regression analysis confirmed that chatbot attributes significantly predict customer satisfaction  
- Personalization was less important to users than efficiency and reliability  

## Recommendations
1. **Optimize Responsiveness**: Ensure real-time replies to enhance satisfaction  
2. **Simplify Usability**: Maintain a user-friendly interface  
3. **Boost Reliability**: Implement fallback solutions to reduce failures  
4. **Improve Connectivity**: Design bots that tolerate low-bandwidth environments  
5. **Customer Education**: Provide onboarding or tips on using chatbots effectively

## Limitations
- **Sample Size**: Limited to 104 students; may not generalize to all demographics  
- **Scope**: Focused solely on online shoppers in Lagos; may differ by region or industry  
- **Technology Bias**: Perception-based data may not reflect actual chatbot performance  
- **No Longitudinal Data**: One-time responses limit insights into evolving user experiences
