# The Relationship Between Leadership Styles and Organisational Performance: A Case Study of Nestlé Nigeria PLC

## Project Overview
This project examines the influence of different leadership styles on organisational performance, with a specific focus on Nestlé Nigeria PLC. It evaluates the impact of transactional, autocratic, and transformational leadership on employee productivity, customer satisfaction, and engagement using quantitative methods such as descriptive statistics, correlation, and regression analysis.

## Data Source
Data was collected via structured questionnaires completed by 18 employees across various departments and job levels at Nestlé Nigeria PLC. The survey captured demographic variables and measured opinions on leadership styles and organisational outcomes.

## Tools
- **Data Collection**: Structured questionnaire (Likert scale: 1–5)  
- **Analysis**: SPSS  
- **Documentation**: Microsoft Word, GitHub  
- **Visual Aids**: Charts and Tables  

## Data Cleaning/Preparation
- Responses with complete data were used (n = 18)  
- Encoded Likert scale responses numerically  
- Grouped demographic variables (gender, age, experience, education, department)  
- Validated data consistency and removed outliers  
- Generated descriptive statistics and correlation matrices for analysis

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

### Demographics Summary
- **Gender**: 61.1% male, 38.9% female  
- **Age**: Highest response rate from age group 18–25 (38.9%)  
- **Job Positions**: Entry-level and Mid-level each had 33.3% of responses  
- **Years of Experience**: 55.6% had under 10 years  
- **Education**: 55.6% had HND/BSc, followed by PGD/MSc (22.2%)  
- **Departments**: Marketing had the highest representation (38.9%)

## Data Analysis

### Descriptive Statistics

#### Transactional Leadership
- **Highest Mean**: "Clearly outlines goals and expectations" (4.39)  
- **Lowest Mean**: "System of rewards and punishments" (3.44)  

#### Employee Productivity
- **Highest Mean**: "I feel motivated to perform" (4.00)  
- **Lowest Mean**: "Resources and support to accomplish tasks" (3.33)  

### Correlation Analysis
- **Transactional Leadership & Employee Productivity**:  
  - r = 0.714, p < 0.01 → **Moderate positive relationship**  
- **Autocratic Leadership & Customer Satisfaction**:  
  - r = -0.642, p < 0.01 → **Moderate negative relationship**

### Regression Analysis

#### Model: Transformational Leadership → Employee Engagement
- **R** = 0.864, **R²** = 0.747 → 74.7% of variance explained  
- **F(1,16)** = 67.840, p < 0.001 → Model statistically significant  
- **Regression Equation**:  
  \[
  \text{Employee Engagement} = 2.169 + 0.868(\text{Transformational Leadership}) + \epsilon
  \]

## Results/Findings
- Transactional leadership practices (goal-setting and feedback) were commonly accepted among staff  
- Employee productivity levels were positively influenced by leadership style  
- Autocratic leadership was found to negatively correlate with customer satisfaction  
- Transformational leadership significantly improved employee engagement, with a strong regression coefficient (β = 0.868)

## Recommendations
1. **Promote Transformational Leadership**: Encourage leaders to adopt visionary and motivating practices  
2. **Balance Transactional Elements**: Maintain structure while incorporating feedback and recognition  
3. **Reduce Autocratic Methods**: Decrease command-based leadership to improve customer and employee satisfaction  
4. **Invest in Resources**: Ensure adequate tools and support are available for task efficiency  
5. **Enhance Interdepartmental Communication**: Boost productivity by improving internal communication structures

## Limitations
- **Sample Size**: Limited to 18 participants; generalizability is low  
- **Single Company**: Focuses solely on Nestlé Nigeria PLC  
- **Self-Reported Data**: Subject to bias and interpretation  
- **Cross-sectional Design**: Does not capture long-term trends or causality
